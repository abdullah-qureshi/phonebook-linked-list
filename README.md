# phonebook-linked-list
A simple CPP program to manage and save contacts.
I have implemented a simple phonebook using linked list data structure. You can add any number of contacts and save them in a .csv file.
The phonebook saves name, phone, email, address, gender and contact relation.

Features:

1. Add Contacts
2. Search (By Name)
3. Delete Contacts
4. Modify Existing contacts
5. List All Contacts
6. Save/Load Contacs from a .csv file.
